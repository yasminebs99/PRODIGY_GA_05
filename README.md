## Neural Style Transfer  

## Description  
A Python-based project that implements Neural Style Transfer to transform images by blending the content of one image with the artistic style of another. This project is ideal for creating unique, artistic renditions of photos, offering a hands-on approach to understanding deep learning applications in computer vision.  

## Features  

- **Artistic Image Transformation**  
  Combines content and style images to produce visually stunning, stylized images using deep learning techniques.  
- **Customizable Style Blending**  
  Allows fine-tuning of the balance between content and style through adjustable hyperparameters.  
- **Pretrained Models**  
  Utilizes state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (e.g., VGG19) for efficient and high-quality transformations.  
- **Easy-to-Use Interface**  
  Includes a user-friendly interface for uploading images and viewing results.  

## Technologies Used  

- Python  
- TensorFlow/Keras (for model implementation)  
- OpenCV (for image processing)  
- NumPy (for mathematical operations)  
- Matplotlib (for visualization)  

## Installation  

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/yasminebs99/PRODIGY_GA_05.git
